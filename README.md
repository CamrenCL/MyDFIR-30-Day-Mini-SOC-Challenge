# MyDFIR-30-Day-Mini-SOC-Challenge
Built a simulated SOC on Vultr using ELK Stack for log analysis, Mythic C2 for penetration testing, and osTicket for automated ticketing. Monitored Sysmon events, detected brute-force/C2 attacks, and developed playbooks. Showcases SIEM, network security, and incident response skills.

## Objective

- Design a SOC pipeline for threat detection and response.

- Configure ELK Stack for log ingestion and visualization.

- Simulate attacks using Mythic C2 and detect via ELK.

- Automate incident ticketing with osTicket.

- Develop playbooks for common threats (brute-force, malware).

### Skills Learned

- How to draw a logical diagram
- How to setup and configure ELK
- How to attack, detect adn investiagte malware (SSH/RDP Brute Force Activity).
- How to create alerts and dashboards using Kibana.
- How to setup and integrate ticketing system.
